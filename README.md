# Excercise

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.

Whole application is built with standalone components and directives.

I implemented each part of specification **except for**:
- searchable table
- *Display history of last 5 results of Heat Index Calculator stored in local storage*

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
